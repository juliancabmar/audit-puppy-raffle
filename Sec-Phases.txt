Finding severity: Using the matrix Impact/Likelihood => (I)/(L)

How to evaluate the impact of a finding

* Impact refers to the potential harm or consequence to the users or the protocol due to the vulnerability.

    High Impact:

        Funds are directly or nearly directly at risk.

        There's a severe disruption of protocol functionality or availability.

    Medium Impact:

        Funds are indirectly at risk.

        There's some level of disruption to the protocol's functionality or availability.

    Low Impact:

        Funds are not at risk.

        However, a function might be incorrect, the state might not be handled appropriately, etc.

How to evaluate the likelihood of exploitation of a finding

* Likelihood represents the probability of the impact occurring due to the vulnerability.
